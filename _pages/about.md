## About me
Hello! I am a tenure-track assistant professor of Biomedical Engineering at Lawrence Technological University (LTU) starting in Fall 2024. Before coming to LTU, I served as a Postdoc Researcher at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, affiliated with the [Artificial Organs Laboratory](/https://www.umms.org/ummc/pros/gme/residency/cardiothoracic-surgery/training/research) mentored by Drs. [Zhongjun Wu](https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/profiles/wu-zhongjun-jon/) and [Bartley Griffith](/https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/profiles/griffith-bartley/). I earned my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from Mississippi State University in 2019, guided by Drs. [Yucheng Liu] and [Mark F. Horstemeyer]. 

**Research Interests**: My research focuses on applying and integrating theoretical approaches, computational models and in vitro/in vivo experiments to: 1) understand and characterize tissue behaviors under physiological and pathological conditions, e.g., myocardial and brain tissue; 2) design and optimize blood-contacting medical devices, e.g., extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and left ventricular assist device (LVAD).
